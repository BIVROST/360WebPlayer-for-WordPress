### Visual Editor

![The wordpress UI](screenshot-2.png)

Open the post or page editor and press the BIVROST 360WebPlayer button. Now you can configure the player and select the videos or pictures you want to display. 

To add videos press the "add source" button. You can add more than one video at once using the shift, opt or control button. For best results add both a webm/vp6 and a mp4/h264 version.

After you save your settings, you will see a placeholder for the player. Press "preview changes" or publish the page to see the player in action.

To edit your player, just click and press "edit" on top of it - just as you would with a normal WordPress video.

### Shortcodes

In text mode, there is a shortcode:

`[bivrost-player loop="true"]
my_vr_movie.mp4
my_vr_movie.webm
[/bivrost-player]`

Put the picture or movie urls in the `[bivrost-player]` tag separated by newlines. For best results add both a webm/vp6 and a mp4/h264 version.

Configure the player using attributes in the shortcode.
