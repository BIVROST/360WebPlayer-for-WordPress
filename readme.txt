Open the post or page editor and press the BIVROST 360WebPlayer button. Now you can configure the player and select the videos or pictures you want to display. 

To add videos press the "add source" button. You can add more than one video at once using the shift, opt or control button. For best results add both a webm/vp6 and a mp4/h264 version.

After you save your settings, you will see a placeholder for the player. Press "preview changes" or publish the page to see the player in action.

To edit your player, just click and press "edit" on top of it - just as you would with a normal WordPress video.

= Shortcodes =

In text mode, there is a shortcode:

`[bivrost-player loop="true"]  
my_vr_movie.mp4  
my_vr_movie.webm  
[/bivrost-player]`

Put the picture or movie urls in the `[bivrost-player]` tag separated by newlines. For the best result add both a webm/vp6 and a mp4/h264 version.

You can configure the player using attributes in the shortcode. Below you can find several options, none of them are required.



= Available options =

*	`theme`: which skin do you want? There are 3 skins available:
	* "default" - black and blue
	* "spring" - black and green
	* "autumn" - black and red
	optional, default: "default"

*	`width`: sets the width of the player. By default the player fits to the available width in a 4:3 aspect ratio. You can override this.
	Provide a value in css units, ex. `500px` or `75%`.

*	`height`: sets the height of the player. By default the height is derived from its width and is set in 4:3 aspect ratio.
	Provide a value in css units, ex. `500px` or `75%`.

*	`loop`: allows the video to loop 
	Allowed values: "true", "false";  
	optional, default: "false".

*	`autoplay`: should the content play automatically?
	Allowed values: "true", "false";  
	optional, default: "true".

*	`stereoscopy`: which form of stereoscopy is used?  
	Allowed values:  
	
	* "autodetect" - detects by filename tags and media ratio (see: Media preparation guide), 
	* "mono" - whole image used,
	* "side-by-side" - the image for left eye is on the left half, and right on the right half of the media,
	* "top-and-bottom" - the left eye is the top half of the image, the right one on the bottom half,
 	* "top-and-bottom-reversed" - the left eye is the bottom half of the image, the right one on the top half;

	optional, default: "autodetect".

*	`source`:  is it a video or picture?
	Allowed values: "video", "picture", "stream-hls", "stream-dash", "autodetect";
	optional, default: "autodetect"
	
*	``projection`: how is the media projected (mapping from 2d to 3d)?
	Allowed value: "equirectangular", "cubemap", "cubemap:configuration...";
	optional, default: "equirectangular".
	Cubemap can be configured through several cubemap types. There are a few presets defining the order: 

	* "horizontal" (default) - all sides of the cube are in one line in the following order; left, right, down, up, back, front. OBRX uses this format.
	* "two-by-three" - all sides are in two rows: left, right, down and up, bottom, front. Facebook 360 videos use this format.
	* "facebook" - the same as two-by-three, but rotated, and each face is cropped by 1%.
	* "horizontal-cross" - all sides are in a cross with bottom, right, front and left in the middle row; up is in the top row and down in the bottom. 
	* "vertical-cross" - up is in the first row, bottom, right and front in the second, left in the third and down in the fourth. ATI CubeMapGen uses this format.
	* custom - advanced, please use presets if possible; you can specify any alignment with a description string. The string is a 2d array of face names in order of how they appear in the texture. The rows are separated by "," and the faces are one letter acronyms (accepts capital letters):

		*  "f" - front
		*  "b" - back
		*  "l" - left
		*  "r" - right
		*  "u" - up
		*  "d" - down
		*  "-" - unused space

	Each face can be rotated with `*x`.  x is a number from 0 to 3. For example `r*1` is right rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

	There are optional modifiers at the end of the string:

	*  ">90" - rotate the whole cube clockwise by 90 degrees
	*  "<72" - rotate the whole cube counter clockwise by 72 degrees
	*  "+0.01" - crop faces by 0.01 (prevents visible edges)

	Example: `-u--,blfr,-d*2-->90+0.002`
	
	Please note that with cubemaps, seams can be visible due to texture filtering - this is most visible on horizontal and vertical crosses. It's best you fix them on pictures by duplicating a border into the unused part of the image. The 1% zoom with Facebook prevents this from happening.
